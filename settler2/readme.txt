1. Memory Requirements

The Settlers II Gold Edition requires
around 7MB of free XMS memory. If you
do not have enough XMS memory
available, the program will first try
to run in a memory-saving mode. This
means that certain graphics will
not be loaded. If this does not
work either, you could try running
the program without music. To do
this, start with the NOSOUND.BAT
batch file.



2. Smartdrive

If you are using MS-DOS, we recommend
you use the "SMARTDRV" program. This
will reduce the loading time of the
game. Please see your DOS instruction
manual on how to use this
program.



3. Two-player Mode

A second mouse is needed to play
this game in two-player mode. It
should be noted that Player One
(the player on the left of the
screen) uses the mouse which is
supported by the mouse driver.
Typically, this mouse will be
connected to either a PS/2 port, or
COM1 or COM2. The second mouse must
be connected to a free COM port.
This must be either COM1 or COM2.
Two-player mode is only possible in
"Unlimited Play" mode (see below).



4. Screen Display - VESA driver

Settlers II Gold Edition supports
the VESA VBE standard for the
support of SuperVGA graphics. Many
SuperVGA graphics cards are
directly compatible with VESA VBE.

If you have problems with your
graphics card, try the following
procedures:

If you have received a VESA VBE
driver with your graphics card,
install this and then try running
the game. Many VESA VBE drivers can
be installed directly from DOS.
Follow the instructions in your
graphics card manual.



5. Autorun (WIN 95)

If you have problems in Windows 95
with the Autorun option, please go to
the AUTORUN.TXT file. There you
will find a list of possible fault
sources.



6. "Unlimited Play" Mode

In this mode you can choose from 30
different scenarios and determine
your enemies as well as various other
options.

- Scenario
Select a map. The size and maximum
number of possible players are
displayed. You can reduce
the number of players by unchecking
the box on the far left of each
player.

- Alliances
Here you indicate which players are
allied to each other.

- Game objective
When is a game won?
This is determined here.

- Merchandise in the storehouse
Here you can set the initial value
for raw materials and workers for
the players. In the "Unlimited Play"
mode the same starting conditions
apply to all players.

- Exploration
If you set this switch to "Off", all
players can see the entire playing
area and all the enemy's buildings
at the same time. "On" is the initial
setting, which also applies when
playing through the "Campaign".

- Start position
If you choose "according to
sequence", the start positions of
all players are the same each time
the scenario is started.

If you wish to play out large
scenarios in "Unlimited Play" mode
and do not have sufficient free
memory, reduce the number of
participating peoples by selecting
members of only one race as
opponents. Make sure you do not have
"People vs People" selected in
"Alliances" (see below).

Some of the larger scenarios are
accessible ONLY to users with more
than 8MB of memory.



7. Alliances Setting (Unlimited Play)

You can set who will be your ally
or foe here. In "People vs. People"
all peoples of the same culture
are on the same side. "Human vs.
Computer" means all computer players
are against you. "Every man for
himself" means that all players
(computer or human) are opponents of
each other.

NOTE: As soon as a player attacks his
allies, these become his enemy. At
the same time, the allies of the
people attacked become the attacker's
enemies. From within the game, the
alliances can be checked in the
General Statistics window. The
colors of the allies are shown as
small rectangles in the players'
portraits.



8. Storage of Merchandise

In the Headquarters and Storehouses
it is now possible to individually
decide for merchandise and workers
whether or not they may
be stored in this particular
storehouse. Players can also choose
which goods are to be taken out of
the Headquarters or Storehouse.



9. Protecting the Headquarters

Players can choose how many soldiers
will protect the headquarters.
They will then only leave to defend
the HQ.



10. The "C" and "S" Keys

During the game, key "C" shows you
the name of the building.
With "S" you can also see how
efficiently your buildings are being
used.



11. Emergency Program

If you receive the message "The
emergency program has been activated"
in the message window, your remaining
stores of wood have been reserved for
building a Woodcutter's hut and a
Sawmill. You should then build these
immediately.



12. Changes since The Settlers II

Tip: Don't build more than one
harbor on each island/continent,
transport will be more efficient
this way.

15. Brief walkthrough of "Chapter 1"

There is a lot to do in "The Settlers
II Gold Edition" so keep playing and
you will keep finding new things to
try.

Once the chapter starts you will get a
message window - this window will pop
up from time to time to give you new
information and tell you what to do
next.

The first thing you need to do is to
build a Woodcutter, Quarry and a
Sawmill. Press the space bar, you
will see the screen fill up with
golden flags and buildings.  The flags
represent places where you can build
roads, and the buildings show where
you can build each of the three sizes
of buildings.

The Woodcutter should be first. Click
on one of the small golden huts, above
and to the left of the HQ (tent). It
is important to remember that a
woodcutter will need trees nearby to
cut down. The window that pops
up is the action window, it allows
you to do many things throughout the
game. Right now it shows all the
types of buildings you could build at
this location. Move the mouse over the
building that shows the Woodcutter
on the bottom of the action window
and click. A empty lot with a blue
flag is now on the screen.

Now you need to connect the blue flag
in front of your HQ to the one in
front of the soon-to-be Woodcutter.
To do this click on the flag in front
of the Woodcutter, the action window
comes up again, this time with
different options. Click the build
road option and then on the flag in
front of the HQ, you now have your
first road. Builders and
helpers will now come out of the HQ
and start to build the Woodcutter's
quarters for you.  You can watch
them moving building materials
(wood and stone) to the new
building site and begin construction.

Now you need to build the Quarry.
The Quarry is also a small sized
building. Follow the same steps
above but build the Quarry close to
the outcrop of rock to the lower
right of the HQ. After all, to create
stone for building the Stonemason
needs large amounts of granite to
work with.  Do not forget to connect
your new building to you road network.

Next is the Sawmill, where the
carpenter works. The Sawmill is the
first medium sized building you will
need. You must click on the golden
icon of a 'L' shaped building on the
map and in the activity window.  Build
the Sawmill as described above.  Do
not forget to connect your new
building to you road network.

By now you should see a dove on the
bottom left of the menu bar on the
bottom of the screen. Now click on
the dove to open the Post Office
window. You will receive many
messages here, from the attack of
other peoples to where a Geologist
finds new raw materials. To close
most windows you can click the top
left corner or right click anywhere
inside the window.

If you're not sure what a button
does press the 'i' key and move the
mouse over the button, it will
give you a short description on the
button.  You can also click on
the '?' in many windows to get a
more complete explanation on what
that window does.

Now experiment.  Try clicking on
the HQ and to see what you
can do there. You can see what
raw materials you have left, how
many people of each profession
you have and how many soldiers
are set to defend your HQ.  You
should not need to make adjustments
to the HQ often, so be careful, you
can unbalance your whole economy
here.

Click on the Sawmill to see what
stock is waiting to be turned
into boards for building.

There are many other windows and
functions in the game, you have
a good start, pay attention to
raw materials and supplies.  Above
all else ...



16. The Map Editor

When you edit the position of
your headquarters, you need to
choose the "castle"- symbol.

The distribution of your raw
materials are shown as percentages
in the test window. Be sure to have
two times as much coal as iron and
gold. The percentage shown for
granite contains only the deposits
in the mountains.

If you choose a resolution higher
than 640x480 but it does
not work, then you may have only
8Meg of RAM or your graphics card
does not support this mode. Try
selecting a different mode or
switching back to 640x480.

When entering a map name and
creator name please make sure
to use the ENTER key when done.
If you do not the information may
not be saved correctly.


Have fun!
