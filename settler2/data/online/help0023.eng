Ships can only be loaded and unloaded in a harbor. Expeditions can also be prepared here. You can release certain merchandise from the storehouse, as and when required. Alternatively, the storage function can be disabled. To do this, first choose the relevant icon followed by the desired merchandise or job symbol.
