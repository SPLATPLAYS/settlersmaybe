This is where you can make adjustments to all military matters. The upper value corresponds to the recruiting rate of your army. The higher it is, the more inhabitants are recruited as soldiers. Below this is the setting to protect your huts. If this value is set at maximum, your huts are defended by the strongest unit. To raise the number of attackers leaving your huts per attack, choose the next setting. The number of defenders who counter the enemy in the event of an attack is shown by the fourth display. The final three values correspond to the occupation of your huts in the interior, in the center of the country and on its borders.
